# AI Tools

This is collection of projects where I explore ways to leverage AI to automate and enhance development workflows for my day to day work. The goal of this repository is to share **useful tooling** built with AI and to **inspire others** to find ways AI can improve their daily work.

## Projects

### **1. Copilot Test Emitter**

ðŸ“Œ **Project:** `copilot-test-emitter`

ðŸš€ **Description:** A tool that automates test generation for TypeSpec-based HTTP services using GitHub Copilot's API. Instead of manually writing tests for each TypeSpec definition, this tool takes TypeSpec input and generates **Vitest test cases**, saving hours of work.

ðŸ“„ **More Details:** See the [project README](./copilot-test-emitter/README.md) and the [final reflections](./copilot-test-emitter/final-thoughts-on-test-generation.md).

## Future Projects

This repository will continue to grow with additional AI-driven tools. If you have **ideas, questions, feedback**, feel free to open an issue, I'm happy to chat.
